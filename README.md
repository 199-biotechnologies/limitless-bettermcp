## Quick Start with npx (No Installation Required!)

You can run this intelligent MCP server directly using npx without any installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "limitless": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["199bio-mcp-limitless-server"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This automatically downloads v0.2.0 with all advanced features when your MCP client starts.

## üéØ Perfect for Claude AI Users

The v0.2.0 upgrade transforms your Claude conversations with Limitless data:

**Before:** "Let me check your logs... *reads through everything* ... based on my analysis..."  
**After:** "What action items came from today's meetings?" ‚Üí *Instant intelligent response*

**Common Use Cases:**
- üíº "Give me a summary of yesterday's meetings"
- ‚úÖ "What do I need to do from today's conversations?"  
- üë• "How much did I talk with my manager this week?"
- üîç "When did I last discuss the budget proposal?"
- üìä "Show me my productivity insights for today"

> **What's MCP?**  
> [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data‚Äîthink of it like the USB-C port or even the HTTP protocol for AI‚Äîuniversal, reliable, and designed for extensibility. The standard that everyone adopts. It enables rich integrations, custom workflows, and seamless communication between AI and the tools you use every day.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As of March 2025, the Limitless API **requires data recorded via the Limitless Pendant**. This server depends on real data recorded from your Limitless Pendant‚Äîit won't return anything meaningful without it. Ensure your Pendant is connected and recording.

**API Status & Future Plans:**
*   The official Limitless API is currently in **beta**. As such, it may occasionally be unreliable, subject to change, or experience temporary outages.
*   Requesting large amounts of data (e.g., listing or searching hundreds of logs) may sometimes result in **timeout errors (like 504 Gateway Time-out)** due to API or network constraints. The server includes a 120-second timeout per API call to mitigate this, but very large requests might still fail.
*   The Limitless API is under **active development**. This MCP server will be updated with new features and improvements as they become available in the official API.
*   **Version 0.2.0** of this MCP server is already under development, with plans to add more robust features and potentially new tools in the near future!

## Features (v0.1.0)

*   **List/Get Lifelogs:** Retrieve Pendant recordings by ID, date, date range, or list recent entries. Includes control over sort direction (`asc`/`desc`).
*   **Search Recent Logs:** Perform simple text searches within the content of a configurable number of recent Pendant recordings (Note: only recent logs are searchable; full-history search is not supported).

> With this server, you can do things like pull action items from your Lifelog and send them directly into Notion‚Äîvia Claude, ChatWise, Windsurf, or any other AI assistant/app that supports MCP.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later required)
*   A Limitless account and API key ([Get one here](https://limitless.ai/developers))
*   **A Limitless Pendant (Required for data)**
*   An MCP Client application (e.g., Claude, Windsurf, Cursor, ChatWise, ChatGPT (coming soon!)) capable of spawning stdio servers and passing environment variables.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Using npx (Recommended - No Installation)

Simply configure your MCP client to use npx as shown in the Quick Start section above. The server will be downloaded and run automatically.

### Option 2: Local Installation

1.  **Clone or download this project.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-limitless-server
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Build the code:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Configuration (Client-Side)

This server expects the `LIMITLESS_API_KEY` to be provided as an **environment variable** when it is launched by your MCP client.

### For npx usage:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "limitless": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["199bio-mcp-limitless-server"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For local installation:

You need to add a server configuration block to your MCP client's settings file. Below are two examples depending on whether you are adding this as your first server or adding it alongside existing servers.

**Example A: Adding as the first/only server**

If your client's configuration file currently has an empty `mcpServers` object (`"mcpServers": {}`), replace it with this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "limitless": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example B: Adding to existing servers**

If your `mcpServers` object already contains other servers (like `"notion": {...}`), add the `"limitless"` block alongside them, ensuring correct JSON syntax (commas between entries):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "some_other_server": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": ["..."],
      "env": {
        "EXAMPLE_VAR": "value"
      }
    },
    "limitless": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>"],
      "env": {
        "LIMITLESS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:**
*   Replace `<YOUR_LIMITLESS_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual Limitless API key.
*   For local installation, replace `<FULL_FILE_PATH_TO_DIST_SERVER.js>` with the correct, **absolute path** to the built server script (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Documents/MCP/mcp-limitless-server/dist/server.js`).
*   MCP config files **cannot contain comments**. Remove any placeholder text and replace it with actual values.

## Running the Server

**For npx:** Your MCP client will automatically download and run the server when needed.

**For local installation:** 
1.  Ensure the server is built successfully (`npm run build`).
2.  Configure your MCP client as shown above.
3.  Start your MCP client application. It will launch the `mcp-limitless-server` process automatically when needed.

## Notes & Limitations

üö´ **Pendant Required**  
This server depends on data generated by the Limitless Pendant.

üß™ **API Beta Status**  
The Limitless API is in beta and may experience occasional instability or rate limiting. Large requests might result in timeouts (e.g., 504 errors).

üîç **Search Scope**  
`limitless_search_lifelogs` only scans a limited number of recent logs (default 20, max 100). It does *not* search your full history ‚Äî use listing tools first for broader analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling & Timeout**  
API errors are translated into MCP error results. Each API call has a 120-second timeout.

üîå **Transport**  
This server uses `stdio` and is meant to be launched by an MCP-compatible client app.
