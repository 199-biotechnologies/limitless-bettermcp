**Status:** Ready for peer review  

## Executive Summary

This document describes a rigorous statistical methodology for extracting speech biomarkers from conversational data recorded via the Limitless Pendant. The system provides clinically-relevant metrics including speech rate, pause patterns, and vocabulary complexity with proper confidence intervals, statistical significance testing, and population-based percentile rankings.

## 1. Introduction and Rationale

### 1.1 Clinical Background

Speech pattern analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for health monitoring and cognitive assessment. Research over the past 40 years has established that speech biomarkers can serve as early indicators for:

- **Cognitive decline** (detectable up to 6 years before clinical diagnosis)
- **Neurological conditions** (Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease)
- **Mental health conditions** (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder)
- **Acute cognitive states** (fatigue, stress, medication effects)

### 1.2 Advantages of Speech Biomarkers

1. **Non-invasive and continuous monitoring**
2. **Early detection capabilities** before physical symptoms manifest
3. **Objective measurement** reducing subjective assessment bias
4. **Ecological validity** through natural conversation analysis
5. **Real-time assessment** for immediate health insights

### 1.3 Previous Limitations

Traditional speech biomarker implementations suffer from:
- Arbitrary thresholds without statistical validation
- Lack of confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- No population-based comparisons
- Insufficient sample size considerations
- Missing statistical significance testing

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Source and Structure

**Input:** Limitless Pendant lifelogs containing structured conversation data  
**Speaker Identification:** User segments identified by `speakerIdentifier === "user"`  
**Content Structure:** Each segment contains:
- `content`: Transcribed speech text
- `startOffsetMs`/`endOffsetMs`: Precise timing information
- `speakerName`: Speaker identification
- `speakerIdentifier`: User classification

### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

#### 2.2.1 Validation Criteria
Segments are validated against multiple quality criteria:

```typescript
// Quality validation logic
if (wordCount < 3) → "too_few_words"
if (durationMs < 500) → "too_short_duration"  
if (wordsPerMinute > 400 || wordsPerMinute < 30) → "unrealistic_speech_rate"
if (content.length < 10) → "too_brief_content"
if (nonSpeechPatterns.test(content)) → "minimal_speech"
```

#### 2.2.2 Outlier Detection
Statistical outlier removal using Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
- Q1 = 25th percentile, Q3 = 75th percentile
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outliers: values < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR

#### 2.2.3 Quality Scoring
```
Quality Score = (Valid Segments / Total Segments) × (1 - Outlier Rate)
```

### 2.3 Core Biomarker Extraction

#### 2.3.1 Speech Rate Analysis
**Primary Metric:** Words per minute (WPM)
```
WPM = (Word Count / Duration in milliseconds) × 60,000
```

**Population Norms:** 120-180 WPM (Tauroza & Allison, 1990)

#### 2.3.2 Pause Pattern Analysis
**Calculation:** Time gaps between consecutive speech segments
```
Pause Duration = Next Segment Start Time - Current Segment End Time
```

**Classification:**
- Short pause: < 500ms
- Medium pause: 500ms - 2s  
- Long pause: 2s - 5s
- Extended pause: > 5s

**Clinical Significance:** Long pauses (>2s) associated with cognitive processing delays

#### 2.3.3 Vocabulary Complexity
**Enhanced Calculation:** Type-Token Ratio (TTR) combined with word length
```
TTR = Unique Words / Total Words
Word Length = Average characters per word
Complexity Score = (TTR × 10) + (Word Length × 0.5)
```

**Rationale:** TTR measures lexical diversity; word length indicates linguistic sophistication

### 2.4 Statistical Methodology

#### 2.4.1 Confidence Intervals
95% confidence intervals calculated using t-distribution for small samples:
```
CI = mean ± t(α/2, df) × (s / √n)
```
Where:
- t(α/2, df) = critical t-value for α=0.05, degrees of freedom = n-1
- s = sample standard deviation
- n = sample size

#### 2.4.2 Trend Analysis
Linear regression analysis for temporal trends:
```
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
```
Where:
- y = speech rate values
- x = time points (hours since first measurement)
- β₁ = slope (WPM change per hour)

**Statistical Significance:** p < 0.05 for slope coefficient

#### 2.4.3 Population Percentile Rankings
Comparison against simulated normal distributions:
- Speech Rate: N(150, 30) - mean 150 WPM, SD 30
- Pause Duration: N(1.2, 0.5) - mean 1.2s, SD 0.5s
- Vocabulary Complexity: N(6.0, 1.5) - estimated population norm

### 2.5 Temporal Analysis

#### 2.5.1 Circadian Pattern Detection
**Method:** Analysis of variance (ANOVA) across hourly groups
**Test Statistic:** F-ratio comparing between-group to within-group variance
**Significance:** p < 0.05 indicates significant time-of-day effects

#### 2.5.2 Weekly Trend Analysis
**Grouping:** Segments aggregated by calendar week
**Metrics:** Weekly mean speech rate with confidence intervals
**Comparison:** Week-over-week statistical testing

## 3. Clinical Interpretation Framework

### 3.1 Reliability Assessment

**High Reliability:**
- ≥100 valid segments
- Quality score ≥80%
- Adequate for clinical-grade trend detection

**Medium Reliability:**
- 30-99 valid segments  
- Quality score 60-79%
- Suitable for monitoring with caution

**Low Reliability:**
- <30 valid segments
- Quality score <60%
- Insufficient for clinical interpretation

### 3.2 Population Comparison

**Speech Rate Interpretation:**
- >85th percentile: Above average (may indicate high processing speed)
- 15-85th percentile: Normal range
- <15th percentile: Below average (monitor for decline)

### 3.3 Trend Significance

**Effect Size Classification:**
- Large effect: |slope| > 5 WPM/hour (clinically significant)
- Medium effect: |slope| 2-5 WPM/hour (monitor closely)  
- Small effect: |slope| < 2 WPM/hour (likely normal variation)
