> **Note:** This document describes the v0.5 advanced biomarker features which have been deprecated in favor of the simplified Speech Vitality Index (SVI) in v0.6.0+. See [SPEECH_VITALITY_INDEX.md](./SPEECH_VITALITY_INDEX.md) for the current approach. The complex system described here has been replaced due to reliability concerns with partial, passive recording data.

## Overview

The enhanced speech biomarker system introduces five major analytical components that work together to provide comprehensive health monitoring through speech patterns:

1. **Speech Rhythm Analysis** - Entropy, consistency, and cognitive load indicators
2. **Disfluency Detection** - Filler words, repairs, and speech planning difficulties
3. **Energy & Fatigue Assessment** - Circadian patterns and predictive analytics
4. **Personal Baseline Tracking** - Individual normal ranges and deviation detection
5. **Environmental Activity Analysis** - Daily patterns, sleep detection, social dynamics

These components integrate with the existing statistical biomarkers to create a holistic health monitoring system accessible through simple queries like "What's my speechclock?"

## New Biomarker Categories

### Core Enhancements

| Category | Metrics | Clinical Relevance |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Rhythm** | Entropy, consistency, burst-pause ratio | Neurological health, cognitive processing |
| **Fluency** | Disfluencies, repairs, planning difficulty | Cognitive load, stress, language processing |
| **Energy** | Fatigue indicators, circadian alignment | Physical health, sleep quality, burnout risk |
| **Personal** | Baseline deviations, trends | Early detection of health changes |
| **Environmental** | Activity patterns, sleep detection, social dynamics | Lifestyle factors, sleep hygiene, social health |

## Speech Rhythm Analysis

### 1. Rhythm Entropy

**Definition:** Shannon entropy of inter-segment intervals, measuring speech pattern regularity.

```
H = -Σ p(i) × log₂(p(i))
```

Where p(i) is the probability of interval i occurring.

**Clinical Significance:**
- Low entropy (0.0-0.3): Highly regular, possibly monotonous speech
- Normal entropy (0.3-0.7): Healthy variation in speech patterns
- High entropy (0.7-1.0): Irregular patterns, possible cognitive issues

### 2. Burst-Pause Ratio

**Definition:** Ratio of speaking time to pause time.

```
BPR = Total Speaking Time / Total Pause Time
```

**Normal Range:** 3:1 to 5:1

**Interpretation:**
- < 2:1 - Excessive pausing, possible processing difficulties
- 3:1 to 5:1 - Normal conversational flow
- > 6:1 - Pressured speech, possible stress or mania

### 3. Speech Momentum

**Components:**
- **Acceleration:** Rate of speech rate change over time
- **Variability:** Standard deviation of WPM changes
- **Smoothness:** Proportion of gradual vs. abrupt changes

**Clinical Applications:**
- Detecting anxiety (rapid acceleration)
- Identifying fatigue (deceleration patterns)
- Monitoring medication effects

### 4. Cognitive Load Indicator

**Calculation:** Weighted combination of:
- Long pause frequency (weight: 0.4)
- Pause irregularity (weight: 0.3)
- Speech variability (weight: 0.2)
- Smoothness deficit (weight: 0.1)

**Score Range:** 0.0 (low load) to 1.0 (high load)

## Disfluency Detection

### 1. Filler Word Analysis

**Tracked Patterns:**
- Classic fillers: "um", "uh", "er", "ah"
- Discourse markers: "like", "you know", "I mean"
- Hesitation phrases: "let me see", "well"

**Normal Rate:** 2-5 per 100 words
**Concern Threshold:** >8 per 100 words

### 2. Repair Detection

**Types:**
- **Self-corrections:** "I mean", "rather", "actually"
- **Restarts:** Incomplete sentences followed by new starts
- **Revisions:** Mid-sentence changes in direction

**Clinical Relevance:**
- Normal: 1-3 repairs per 100 words
- Elevated: >5 repairs indicates planning difficulties
- Associated with: Anxiety, cognitive overload, aphasia

### 3. Word-Searching Behaviors

**Patterns:**
- "What's the word"
- "You know what I mean"
- "That thing"
- Circumlocution

**Significance:** Early indicator of:
- Word-finding difficulties
- Cognitive decline
- Fatigue effects

### 4. Speech Planning Difficulty Score

**Formula:**
```
SPD = 0.3 × repair_rate + 0.3 × hesitation_rate + 
      0.2 × incomplete_rate + 0.2 × search_rate
```

**Interpretation:**
- 0.0-0.2: Normal speech planning
- 0.2-0.5: Mild difficulties
- 0.5-0.8: Moderate difficulties
- 0.8-1.0: Severe planning issues

## Energy & Fatigue Assessment

### 1. Energy Scoring Algorithm

**Components (weights):**
- Speech rate normalization (30%)
- Vocabulary complexity (25%)

Energy = Σ(component × weight) × 100
```

### 2. Fatigue Indicators

**Detection Criteria:**

### 3. Circadian Pattern Analysis

**Methodology:**
1. Group data by hour of day
2. Calculate mean energy per hour
3. Identify peak and trough times

**Alignment Score:** 0.0-1.0 (similarity to normal circadian rhythm)

### 4. Predictive Analytics

**Energy Predictions:**

By analyzing rhythm, fluency, energy, environmental patterns, and personal baselines, we can detect health changes earlier and more accurately than ever before. The "speechclock" concept makes this powerful technology accessible through natural language queries, democratizing access to clinical-grade health insights.
